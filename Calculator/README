  1. PROJECT SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This purpose of this project is to implement a simple calculator.  The goal
was to emulate a "cheap" version of a calculator such that many of the 
supported operations are in the software, vice in the hardware.  With that, 
various common mathematical expressions (including trivial tasks such as 
subtraction and division) were carefully implemented in the software.

The calculator supports the follow (required) functions:
   - On/Off
   - Clear Last Entry / Clear All
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - +/- (unary "minus")
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Floor
   - Ceiling
   - Reciprocal
   - Square Root
   - Parenthesis
   
The calculator also supports the following functions that 
were not required by the project specification:
   - Factorial
   - Exponentiation (x^2, x^y)

The underlying architecture of the software follows an Model-View-Controller
(MVC) design pattern.  The MVC design pattern is a mechanism that separates
the various responsibilities of an application between the model and the view
and utilizes the controller to effectively "orchestrate" or "wire" the 
flow of data between the two.

The CalculatorModel class retains the state of the calculator.  The state
consists of whether or not the calculator is on or off, whether of not an error
flag has been set, and of course the active (and last) expression parsed or
being input into the calculator.

The CalcutatorView is ignorant of the operations of the calculator and has
the sole purpose of display data (as dictated by the controller), and 
issuing events when various buttons are pressed.

The CalculatorController binds to the events that are fired in the view and
the model respectively, and responds to each as necessary.  For example, when
a button is pressed, the view fires an event that the controller is listening
to.  If the event fired was that of a button click, then type and attributes
of the button are gleaned to determine how the calculator should react.  If
the button were the "3" button, for example, the controller would append a 
morpheme representing the number 3 to the active expression (or phrase)
that is held in the Model.  The model would then recognize that the active
phrase had been updated and would throw an event.  Again, the controller is
wired to listen to events thrown by the model, including updates to the active 
phrase.  In this case, an update to the active phrase would induce the
controller to then update the visual display of the active display, using the
View. 

Within the software, each mathematical function implemented within the 
calculator has been abstracted into it's own respective "Evaluator".  A facade 
of the various mathematical functions (MathUtil) is available for easy access 
to the various methods.

An implementation of Vaughan Pratt's technique is used to create our parser.
The Pratt Parser is a recursive descent parser that employs the notion of
operator precedence ("top-down") and allows us to associate parsing behavior,
called "parselets," with the tokens instead of grammar rules.  Our parser is
an LL1 parser and the Parser class is what owns the Token stream and handles
the look-ahead.  The parselets encode specific prefix, infix and postfix
behavior to include operation, associativity and precedence.  This is easily
done by registering a parselet instance with a specific type of token.  Such
abstraction allows us to easily incorporate new parselet/token-type pairings
without having to re-write the Parser class.  As parselets are parsed, they
are returned as new expressions which are passed back up as the recursive
calls unwind.  The real magic of Pratt's technique lies in the ability to
pass a precedence value to the expression parser to let it know which
expressions it can parse.  The passed precedence is recursively carried
through the calls and is what triggers a stop to the recursion when a lower-
valued precedence is encountered (owned by an encountered expression).  Left
associativity is handled by passing the same precedence to the expression
parser and to get right associativity, precedence is decreased by one before
passing it to the expression parser.

  2. GETTING STARTED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the application, a friendly batch/shell script has been provided for
various operating environments.

   A. [Windows]: At a command prompt, or from within Windows Explorer, execute 
      the following batch script:
      
         %PROJECT_HOME%/bin/calculator.bat
         
   B. [UNIX/Linux using XTerm]: Execute the following shell script script:
      
         %PROJECT_HOME%/bin/calculator.bat
         
   C. [Command line]: From the root of the project, execute the following 
      command:
      
         java -classpath "./lib/*:./dist/calculator.jar" \ 
            edu.odu.cs.cs600.calculator.Application

  3. DEVELOPER NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project has been developed using Eclipse (as the project contains a 
project file that can be used in Eclipse), but can also be fully built 
using Ant.

The project's source code repository is hosted in a private repository at
GitHub, at the following address: https://github.com/jasel-lewis/cs600project1

Various ANT targets are available in the build file.  The documentation below 
assumes that Ant has been installed on your machine and is available on 
your path.

TARGET: main (default)

   Cleans all output directories, compiles the project, builds a jar file,
   generated javadocs, compiles and executes all JUnit test cases, and 
   executes the application
   
TARGET:  run

   Runs the application (assumes project is already built)
   
TARGET: test

   Executes all JUnit unit tests against the various evaluators
   
TARGET: docs

   Generates all javadocs for the project
